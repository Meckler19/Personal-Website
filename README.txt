on the main page i want to make it so that clicking on the icons makes the information appear

right now opacity is at 0 but i cant figure out how to make it change'

i would like to get rid of the white space at the end of the page on index.html

i need to style up my other pages. I still think it's not a horrible idea just to add them onto the bottom of this one
